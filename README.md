**About Me**
	Hi, my name is Skyler Andersen. I am a computer programmer, currently in year two of pursuing my Bachelors. I mainly program in Java, but I am proficient with C++, and use LaTeX all the time for notes and formal documents. I have also worked with MIPS for reverse engineering and to get experience with writing assemblers and disassemblers.

**Current Projects**
	Currently I am working on an attendance tracker to help teachers recognize students that need extra assistance remaining in the classroom and focussing on their studies.

Completed Projects
	Once I get some completed projects on here, I will make updates.
