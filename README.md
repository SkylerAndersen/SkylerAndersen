**About Me**  
>   Hi, my name is Skyler Andersen. I am a computer programmer, currently in year two of pursuing my Bachelors. I mainly program in Java, but I am proficient with C++, and use LaTeX all the time for notes and formal documents. I have also worked with MIPS for reverse engineering and to get experience with writing assemblers and disassemblers.  
  
**Current Projects**  
>   Currently I am working on an attendance tracker to help teachers recognize students that need extra assistance remaining in the classroom and focussing on their studies. I am also working on a custom programming language usable for Minecraft data pack development, and a suit of compilers/transpilers to turn the programming language into a custom pseudo assembly/bytecode and into different Minecraft command syntaxes.  
  
**Completed Projects**  
>  Right now, my explorations folder has some code snippets from topics in computer science that I have looked into or explored. I will make updates when larger projects are finished.
