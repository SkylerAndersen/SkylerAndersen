 **LaTeX Documents**  
  
    This folder contains examples of LaTeX documents that I have put together. These documents contain information on the subject on Linear Algebra. For convenience, two larger documents have been made containing the pages from the individual documents, but the individual documents are available here as well.
     The documents with larger numbers are more recent, and stronger examples of quality LaTeX usage.
