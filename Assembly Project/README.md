 **Assembly Project**  
  
    This folder contains a project that involved the creation of a custom assembly language. This language can be typed out in a custom IDE with a custom assembler. The IDE also has an interpreter, built with Java, that can interpret the custom instructions and simulate the execution of this custom language.
     As of version 1, the project involves over 2000 lines of code, spanning across +15 different classes. All aspects are from scratch, and no libraries were used outside of the Java Standard Library.
